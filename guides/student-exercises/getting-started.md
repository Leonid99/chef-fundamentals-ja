Getting Started
======================

## Objectives

* Install Ruby and Chef
* Create an initial Chef Repository
* Set up connectivity to Chef Server
* Questions

## Acceptance Criteria

* Executables chef-client, knife, ohai and shef are in the user PATH
* An initial Chef Repository is created (optionally under version control).
* Successful connection to the Chef Server can be made with `knife`.
* Answered the questions.

## Install Ruby and Chef

If Ruby and Chef are not already installed on the local workstation,
do so now. Use the Opscode Full Stack Installer:

* http://www.opscode.com/chef/install

__Hint__: This will by default install in `/opt/opscode` or
  `C:\Opscode` depending on platform.

## Create Chef Repository

Create a directory named `chef-repo` in your home directory on the
local workstation. It should have two sub-directories `.chef`, and
`cookbooks`.

### Optional:

Make the Chef Repository version controlled. You may use Git,
Subversion or any other version control system you wish.

## Access Chef Server

Create the knife configuration file in the Chef Repository to connect
to the Chef Server. Copy your user private key file and Chef Server
validation key file to the same directory.

Verify connectivity to the Chef Server for your user with knife on the
local workstation.
