Anatomy of a Chef Run
======================

## Objectives

* Configure remote target to run `chef-client`
* Successful `chef-client` run with debug logging

## Acceptance Criteria

* Client and node objects exist on Chef Server
* Debug log output from `chef-client`
* Answer the questions

## Create Configuration

Create a configuration file for your local workstation. The default location per platform:

* Unix/Linux: `/etc/chef/client.rb`
* Windows: `C:\chef\client.rb`

At a minimum, the configuration should include the Chef Server URI, and the name of the validation API client.

Optionally add file location configuration so Chef can write files in an area owned by a non-privileged user. Configuration settings:

* `checksum_path`
* `file_cache_path`
* `file_backup_path`
* `cache_options`

## Use Validation Key

Use the validation key for the Chef Server to automatically create the new API client. It should be copied to the same directory as the `client.rb` file.

## Run Chef Client

Run `chef-client` on the local system with debug logging output by default, and send the output to a file. Use the output file, along with the command-line tools to answer the following questions.

Unless you add configuration for file locations, you'll need to run `chef-client` as a privileged user.

## Questions

What is the name of the node and client created on the Chef Server? What commands can be used to get these values?

What are two ways to change the name of the node and client at `chef-client` run time?

What are the platform and platform version of the node?

Does the node have a run list?

What is the IP address detected for the node? Is it the correct default IP address?

Is the API client an admin? What command can be used to show this information?

Does the validation key file still exist? Why?

What kind of HTTP request is made to save the node? When does this occur?
