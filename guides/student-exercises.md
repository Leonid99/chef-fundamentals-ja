The current Student Exercise guide is `handholder-exercises.md`. These
include more "hand holding" to assist students, but don't facilitate
learning and reinforcement. As the course materials stand, use these
exercises for conducting the course hands on exercises.

Student exercises are being rewritten and will be in the
`student-exercises` directory, one file per section of the same
name. The course materials need to be updated to match how the
exercises will be conducted.
